# Sprint 2: Stringer things
We are the Stringer Things team, composed by Laura, Raquel, Olatz and Loreto.

This is our second project in Adalab. During the last three weeks we have been studying JavaScript from zero. So we are glad to show you what we have done.

We have been working to reach a milestone every week.

- First two days:

  >  We spent the first two days organizing how to work. For this we used Trello, following the Agile methodology Kanban, so it is been easier to distribute the work and to know in which section should work each member.

- First week:

  >  We spent one week doing our HTML and SCSS documents. We webpage is composed by to different pages: the first one is the landing page with a Button to start and the second one is where the user can create a personalized card. We did the first version of the web but it wasn't interactive.

  - Second week:

  >  We started to work with JavaScript. We worked doing pair programming. Two members of the team worked with the part of the Design while the other two members worked with the fillable form.

  - Third week:

  >  We worked with the form. The objetive was to create a preview while the user was fulfilling the form.

    - Fourth week:

  >  We worked with the buttons to create the form and to create the link with the final card of the user. The worked during all the project with Git so we started to merge the different branches and to do pull requests to our team mates. 


    - Fifth week:

  > The fifth week was composed by two days. We merged the last branches solving all the conflicts, we fixed the last SCSS details and we cleaned our JavaScript code. We prepared the presentation and our speechs to do the presentation.
